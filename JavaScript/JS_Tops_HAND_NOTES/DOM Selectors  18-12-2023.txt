1. Single Element Selectors
2. Multiple Element Selectors

** What is DOM Manupulation ?

>> DOM manipulation refers to the process of changing the content, structure, or style of a webpage using JavaScript. Developers can dynamically update or modify elements, such as text, images, or attributes, to create interactive and responsive user experiences without requiring a full page reload.

>> Dom Manupulation means using js style html tag or error etc using DOM selectors (getElementId or getelementsbyClass)
