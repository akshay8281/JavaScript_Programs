        <p>JavaScript provides several looping structures to repeatedly execute code. One fundamental structure is the
            "for loop,"
            particularly useful when the number of iterations is known in advance. Its syntax involves three components:
            initialization, condition, and update. For example:</p>
        <h6>for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(i); } </h6>
                <p>Here, the loop initializes a variable i to 0, continues as long as i is less than 5, and increments i
                    after each
                    iteration. The output will be:</p>
                <p>
                <h6>Result</h6>0
                1
                2
                3
                4
                </p>
                <p>Another commonly used structure is the "while loop," suitable when the exact number of iterations
                    isn't predetermined.It repeats as long as a specified condition remains true:
                </p>
                <h6>
                    var i = 0;
                    while (i < 5) { console.log(i); i++; } </h6>
                        <p>This loop achieves the same result as the "for loop." Additionally, the "do-while loop"
                            guarantees the execution of the
                            block at least once before evaluating the condition. These looping structures are essential
                            for handling repetition in
                            JavaScript, enabling efficient and flexible code execution.
