            7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
        </h3>

        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>ViewState and SessionState are concepts in the context of web development, particularly in ASP.NET. Here are
            the key
            differences between ViewState and SessionState in bullet points:</p>
        <ul>
            <h5>ViewState:</h5>
            <li>ViewState is used to store the state of a page's controls.</li>
            <li>It is used to persist page-specific information across postbacks.</li>
            <li>Data is stored on the client side as hidden fields in the page.</li>
            <li>ViewState is maintained on a per-page basis.</li>
            <li>It is suitable for storing small amounts of data specific to a page</li>
            <li>ViewState is part of the page's HTML and is transferred between the client and the server with each
                request/response.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h5>SessionState:</h5>
            <li>SessionState is used to store user-specific information across multiple pages.</li>
            <li>It allows data to be stored on the server and associated with a user's session.</li>
            <li>Data is stored on the server side, typically in-process or in an external session state provider (like a
                database or a
                separate server).</li>
            <li>SessionState is maintained on a per-user basis, allowing data to persist across different pages for a
                specific user.</li>
            <li>It is suitable for storing larger amounts of data that need to be shared across pages during a user's
                session.</li>
            <li>SessionState requires more server resources compared to ViewState, especially if the session state is
                stored
                out-of-process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, ViewState is used to maintain the state of controls on a single page across postbacks, while
            SessionState is
            used to store user-specific data that needs to persist across multiple pages during a user's session on a
            website.</p>
