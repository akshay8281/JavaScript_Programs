            7. What is === operator?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>The === operator in JavaScript is the strict equality operator. It is used to compare two values for equality
            without
            performing any type coercion. In other words, both the value and the type of the operands must be the same
            for the ===
            operator to return true. If either the value or the type is different, the operator returns false.</p>
        <p>Here are some key points about the === operator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strict Equality: It checks both value and type, ensuring that both are identical.</li>
            <li>5 === "5"; // Returns false (number is not equal to string) <br>
                5 === 5; // Returns true (number is equal to number)
            </li>
            <li>Type Coercion: Unlike the loose equality operator ==, which performs type coercion (attempts to convert
                operands to the
                same type before making the comparison), === does not perform any type conversion. This helps avoid
                unexpected and
                potentially error-prone behavior.</li>
            <li>Usage: It is commonly used when precise equality checking is required, and type information is crucial.
            </li>
            <li>Recommended Practice: In many cases, using === is preferred over == because it avoids unintended type
                conversions,
                leading to more predictable and less error-prone code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example illustrating the difference between == and ===:</p>
        <h5>"5" == 5; // Returns true (loose equality, type coercion is performed) <br>
            "5" === 5; // Returns false (strict equality, different types)
        </h5>
        <p>In summary, the === operator is a strict equality operator that checks both the value and the type of
            operands, making
            it a useful tool for precise and reliable equality comparisons in JavaScript.</p>
