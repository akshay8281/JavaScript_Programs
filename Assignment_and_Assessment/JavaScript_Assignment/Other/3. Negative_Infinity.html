            3. What is negative Infinity?
        </h3>

        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest
            available.
            This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or
            by an
            arithmetic operation.</p>
        <h5>Note: JavaScript shows the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.</h5>
        <p>Negative infinity is different from mathematical infinity in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by any other number.</li>
            <li>When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN</li>
            <li>Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is negative
                infinity.</li>
            <li>Negative infinity, divided by any negative number (apart from negative infinity) is positive infinity.
            </li>
            <li>If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.</li>
            <li>The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.</li>
            <li>The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.</li>
            <li>The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.</li>
        </ul>
