            2. What is the use of isNaN function?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>The isNaN function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not. NaN is a
            special
            value in JavaScript that represents the result of an operation that could not produce a meaningful numeric
            result. It is
            often returned when attempting to convert a non-numeric string to a number or when performing operations
            that result in
            undefined or unrepresentable values.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The isNaN function takes a single argument and returns true if the argument is NaN, and false otherwise. Here's
        an
        example:</p>
    <h5>
        let value1 = 42; <br>
        let value2 = "Hello"; <br>

        console.log(isNaN(value1)); // Output: false, as 42 is a valid number <br>
        console.log(isNaN(value2)); // Output: true, as "Hello" cannot be converted to a number

    </h5>
    <p>In the example, isNaN(value1) returns false because value1 is a valid number. However, isNaN(value2) returns true
        because attempting to convert the string "Hello" to a number results in NaN.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that isNaN attempts to convert the argument to a number before checking if it is NaN. If
        the
        argument is not a number or a string that can be converted to a number, isNaN returns true. To check for a NaN
        value
        without automatic type conversion, you can use the Number.isNaN method introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6):</p>
    <h5>
        console.log(Number.isNaN(value1)); // Output: false <br>
        console.log(Number.isNaN(value2)); // Output: false
    </h5>
    <p>In this case, Number.isNaN returns false for both values because it doesn't perform type coercion. It only
        returns true
        if the provided value is exactly NaN.</p>
