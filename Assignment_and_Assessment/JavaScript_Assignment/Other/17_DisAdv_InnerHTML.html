            17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>Using innerHTML in JavaScript for manipulating HTML content has some drawbacks:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Security Risks:</li>
            <p>Assigning user-generated or untrusted content to innerHTML can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as
                Cross-Site
                Scripting (XSS) attacks. If the content is not properly sanitized, malicious scripts may be executed.
            </p>
            <li>Performance Overhead:</li>
            <p>Manipulating innerHTML can be less efficient than other DOM manipulation methods, especially when dealing
                with large
                documents. It involves parsing and serializing the HTML content, leading to potential performance
                bottlenecks.</p>
            <li>Overwrites Event Handlers:</li>
            <p>When you set innerHTML, existing event handlers on elements are often lost. If you have attached event
                listeners to
                elements, using innerHTML might unintentionally remove those listeners.</p>
            <li>Limited Error Handling:</li>
            <p>innerHTML does not provide detailed error handling. If the HTML content you're trying to inject is
                malformed, it might
                lead to unexpected results without clear error messages.</p>
            <li>Limited Control:</li>
            <p>Using innerHTML replaces the entire content within an element. If you only need to modify a small part of
                the content or
                if you want more control over insertion points, other DOM manipulation methods like appendChild or
                insertAdjacentHTML
                might be more suitable.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>To address these issues, consider using alternative methods like DOM manipulation, template literals, or
            dedicated
            libraries/frameworks that offer better security and performance while mitigating the risks associated with
            innerHTML.</p>
