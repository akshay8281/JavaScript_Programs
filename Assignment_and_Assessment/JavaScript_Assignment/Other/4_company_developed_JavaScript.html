        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation. Brendan Eich, a Netscape employee, created
            the language
            in 1995. Initially, it was named "Mocha," but it was later renamed "LiveScript." Finally, to capitalize on
            the
            popularity of Java at that time, it was renamed "JavaScript" when Netscape and Sun Microsystems entered into
            a
            collaboration agreement. Despite the name, JavaScript and Java are distinct programming languages with
            different
            purposes and features. JavaScript was quickly adopted as a scripting language for web browsers, and its
            widespread use
            contributed to the dynamic and interactive nature of the early web.</p>
