            5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?

        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>Undeclared and undefined variables are related concepts in JavaScript, but they refer to different
            situations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Undeclared Variables:
                <ul>
                    <li>An undeclared variable is a variable that has been used in the code without being declared using
                        the var, let, or const
                        keywords.</li>
                    <li>Using an undeclared variable can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally considered a
                        mistake.</li>
                    <li>In strict mode ("use strict";), attempting to use an undeclared variable will result in a
                        ReferenceError.</li>
                    <p>// Undeclared variable <br>
                        x = 10; <br>
                        console.log(x); // This will work, but it's not recommended.
                    </p>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Undefined Variables:
                <ul>
                    <li>An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
                    </li>
                    <li>In JavaScript, when you declare a variable without assigning a value to it, it is automatically
                        assigned the value
                        undefined.</li>
                    <li>It's important to note that undefined is a special value in JavaScript that represents the
                        absence of a value or an
                        uninitialized variable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>// Undefined variable <br>
                    let y; <br>
                    console.log(y); // Output: undefined
                </p>
                <p>let z = undefined; <br>
                    console.log(z); // Output: undefined
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, an undeclared variable is one that has not been declared using var, let, or const, while an
            undefined
            variable is one that has been declared but has not been assigned a value (or explicitly assigned the value
            undefined).
            It's generally good practice to declare variables before using them to avoid potential issues and make the
            code more
            readable.</p>
