            Q.18 What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?
        </h3>
    </div>

        <span>Ans - </span>
        <P>A loop is a control flow structure in programming that allows a set of instructions to be repeatedly executed
            until a
            certain condition is met. JavaScript provides several types of loops, including `for`, `while`, and
            `do-while`.</P>
        <P>`for` loop:** Executes a block of code a specified number of times. It has three parts: initialization,
            condition,
            and increment/decrement.</P>
        <H5>
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) <br>
                { // Code to be repeated }
        </H5>

        <p>`while` loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a
            specified condition is true.</p>

        <h5>
            let i=0; <br>
            while (i < 5) { <br>
                // Code to be repeated i++; }
        </h5>
        <p>
            `do-while` loop: Similar to `while` loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once
            before checking the condition.
        </p>
        <h5>
            let i=0;<br>
            do { <br>
            // Code to be repeated i++; } while (i < 5); </h5>

                <h4>Switch Case in JavaScript:</h4>
                <p>
                    A switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It evaluates
                    an expression against multiple possible case values and executes the code associated with the first
                    matching case.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    let day=3; <br>
                    switch (day) { <br>
                    case 1: console.log("Monday"); <br>
                    break;<br>
                    case 2: console.log("Tuesday"); <br>
                    break; <br>
                    // ... other cases default: console.log("Invalid day"); }
                </h5>
                <p>In this example, if `day` is `3`, it will execute the
                    code block associated with `case 3`. The `break` statement is crucial to prevent fall-through,
                    meaning execution would continue into the next case without it. The `default` case is optional and
                    is executed when none of the cases match.</p>
