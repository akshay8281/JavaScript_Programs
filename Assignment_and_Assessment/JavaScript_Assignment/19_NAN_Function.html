        <p>In JavaScript, the `isNaN` function serves the purpose of checking whether a given value is NaN (Not a
            Number) or not.
            NaN is a special value representing the result of an undefined or unrepresentable mathematical operation,
            often
            occurring in scenarios like dividing zero by zero or attempting to convert non-numeric values to numbers.
        </p>
        <p>The `isNaN` function returns a boolean value, `true` if the provided argument is NaN and `false` otherwise.
            It also
            attempts to convert the argument to a number before making the NaN check. If the argument is not a number or
            cannot be
            converted to a number, the function returns `true`. This behavior makes `isNaN` useful for validating
            whether a value is
            a valid numeric input.</p>
        <p>However, it's crucial to note that `isNaN` has some quirks. It performs type coercion, converting
            non-numeric values to
            numbers before the NaN check. For more precise checks without type coercion, developers often prefer to use
            `Number.isNaN`. This method only returns `true` if the provided value is of the type `Number` and is also
            NaN, making it
            a more reliable choice for checking numeric values in a strict manner.</p>
