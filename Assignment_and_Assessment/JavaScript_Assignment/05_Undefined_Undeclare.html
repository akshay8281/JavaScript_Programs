        <h3>Q.5 What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript, the terms "undefined" and "undeclared" pertain to distinct scenarios in variable usage.
            Undefined: When a variable is declared but lacks an assigned value, it is considered "undefined." This
            occurs when a
            variable is explicitly declared using var, let, or const, but it is not initialized with a value. Similarly,
            when a
            function does not explicitly return a value, the result is also undefined. For example:
        <p>let x; // Declared but not assigned <br>
            console.log(x); // Output: undefined</p>
        </p>
        <p>Undeclared: "Undeclared" refers to trying to use a variable that has not been declared at all in the current
            scope. This
            results in a ReferenceError. For instance:</p>
        <p>console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</p>
        <p>In this example, there is no prior declaration of the variable y in the current scope, leading to a
            ReferenceError.
            Distinguishing between "undefined" and "undeclared" is crucial for effective debugging and maintaining code
            clarity, as
            it helps developers identify whether an issue stems from uninitialized variables or attempting to use
            variables that
            haven't been declared.</p>
