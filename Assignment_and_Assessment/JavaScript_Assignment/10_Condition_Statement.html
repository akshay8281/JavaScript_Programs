        <p>
            In JavaScript, a condition statement is a fundamental programming construct that enables the execution of
            different code
            blocks based on the evaluation of a specified condition. The most common type of condition statement is the
            "if
            statement." It begins with the keyword "if," followed by a condition enclosed in parentheses. If the
            condition evaluates
            to true, the code block associated with the if statement is executed; otherwise, it may be followed by an
            optional
            "else" block, which contains code to be executed when the condition is false.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more complex scenarios, developers can use "else if" statements to test multiple conditions in sequence.
            Additionally, the "switch" statement provides an alternative for handling multiple possible conditions.
            Condition
            statements play a crucial role in controlling the flow of a program, allowing developers to create flexible
            and
            responsive code that responds to different situations.
