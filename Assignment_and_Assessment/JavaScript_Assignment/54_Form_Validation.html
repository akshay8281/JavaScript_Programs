            Form validation in JavaScript is a process of ensuring that user input in HTML forms meets specified
            criteria before it
            is submitted to the server. Proper validation enhances user experience, reduces errors, and ensures data
            integrity.
            Here's a basic overview of form validation in JS:
        </p>
        <p>1. HTML Form Markup:
            Include the necessary HTML form elements and input fields with proper attributes, such as required, pattern,
            and type,
            to indicate the expected format of data.</p>
        <p>2. JavaScript Validation Logic:
            Use JavaScript to add event listeners to the form, capturing the submission event. In the event handler,
            perform
            validation checks on the form fields.</p>
        <p>3. Accessing Form Elements:
            Use the document.getElementById or other DOM methods to access form elements and retrieve user input for
            validation.</p>
        <p>4. Validation Conditions:
            Apply conditions such as checking for empty fields, validating email formats, verifying password strength,
            and ensuring
            data consistency according to the specified requirements.</p>
        <p>5. Displaying Error Messages:
            If validation fails, dynamically create and display error messages near the corresponding form fields to
            guide users on
            correcting input errors.</p>
        <p>6. Preventing Form Submission:
            Use event.preventDefault() to stop the form from being submitted if validation conditions are not met,
            allowing users to
            correct errors before submission.</p>
        <p>Implementing client-side form validation improves the user experience by providing instant feedback, reducing
            the
            likelihood of invalid data reaching the server, and promoting a more efficient and error-free data entry
            process.
            Additionally, server-side validation should always be implemented to ensure data integrity and security.</p>
