            Q.60 Array vs object defences in JS?
        </h3>

            Ans -
        </span>
        <p>It seems like there might be a slight confusion in your question, but I'll provide information on both arrays
            and
            objects in JavaScript.</p>
        <h6>Arrays in JavaScript:</h6>
        <p>* Definition: An array is a data structure that stores elements sequentially. It is a special type of object
            that uses
            integer-based keys (indices) to organize and access its elements.</p>
        <p>* Use Cases: Arrays are suitable for ordered collections of data. They are commonly used for lists of items
            where the
            order matters, such as a list of numbers, strings, or objects.</p>
        <h6>let myArray = [1, 2, 3, "four", { key: "value" }];
        </h6>
        <h6>Objects in JavaScript:</h6>
        <p>* Definition: An object is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. Keys (or properties) can be
            strings or
            symbols, and values can be any valid JavaScript data type.</p>
        <p>* Use Cases: Objects are useful for representing and organizing data in a more arbitrary way. They are often
            used for
            creating structured data, such as representing entities with different attributes.</p>
        <h6>
            let myObject = {
            name: "John",
            age: 25,
            city: "Exampleville"
            };

        </h6>
        <h6>Defenses in JavaScript:</h6>
        <p>If by "defenses" you mean advantages or use cases:</p>
        <h6>** Arrays:</h6>
        <p>* Efficiently store and access ordered collections of data.</p>
        <p>* Useful for operations that require iterating through elements sequentially.</p>
        <h6>** Objects:</h6>
        <p>* Provide a flexible way to structure and organize data using key-value pairs.</p>
        <p>* Ideal for representing entities with different attributes.</p>
        <p>If you meant something else by "defenses," please provide additional clarification so I can better address
            your
            question.</p>
