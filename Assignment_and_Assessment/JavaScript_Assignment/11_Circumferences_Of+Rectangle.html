    <div>
        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>The formula � = 4 × � C=4×a is not the correct formula for the circumference of a rectangle. The term
            "circumference" is usually associated with round shapes like circles, and rectangles don't have a
            circumference. The correct term for the measure around a rectangle is the "perimeter."</p>
        <p>The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is � = 2 ×(length + width) P=2×(length+width). If all sides of
            the rectangle are equal (a square), then � = 4 × � P=4×a, where � a is the length of one side.</p>
        <p>
            So, in simple words, if you want to find the measure around a rectangle, you use the perimeter formula, not
            the
            circumference formula. The perimeter is found by adding up the lengths of all the sides.
