        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>DOM (Document Object Model):
            The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure
            of a
            document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document (such as elements,
            attributes,
            and text). The DOM provides a way for programs to manipulate the structure, style, and content of web
            documents. It
            allows developers to interact with and modify the HTML and XML content of a web page dynamically. The DOM is
            mainly
            concerned with how the document is structured and how to access, manipulate, and update its elements.</p>
        <p>BOM (Browser Object Model):
            The BOM, or Browser Object Model, is a programming interface that provides objects and methods to interact
            with the
            browser itself rather than the document. It includes objects like window, navigator, screen, history, and
            location. The
            BOM is not standardized, and its features may vary between browsers. The window object is a key part of the
            BOM and
            represents the browser window, providing methods and properties for controlling and interacting with the
            browser.</p>
        <p>In summary, while the DOM focuses on representing and manipulating the structure and content of documents,
            the BOM deals
            with the browser window and its components. The DOM is a standard model for documents, ensuring consistency
            across
            different browsers, while the BOM is more browser-specific and provides functionality related to the browser
            environment.</p>
