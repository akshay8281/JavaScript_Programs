            Q.2 How many type of Variable in JavaScript?
        </h1>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. There are three types of variables based on
            their
            declaration: var, let, and const.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. var: Historically used, but now considered outdated, var declares a variable globally or locally within a
            function,
            with the potential for issues like variable hoisting and it is in LOCAL SCOPE.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. let: Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let allows the declaration of block-scoped variables. It is
            reassignable,
            making it suitable for situations where the variable's value may change.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. const: Also introduced in ES6, const declares a variable with a constant value, meaning its value cannot
            be
            reassigned after initialization. It is block-scoped like let but provides a way to create constants in
            JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Choosing the appropriate variable type depends on the scope and mutability requirements of the variable in a
            given
            context.
