        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>The expression '(5 > 3 && 2 < 4)' is a logical expression in JavaScript that uses the logical AND operator
                ("&&"). The expression evaluates to "true" because both conditions on either side of the "&&" operator
                are true:</p>
                <p>"5 > 3" is true. <br>
                    "2 < 4" is true.</p>
                        <p>When both conditions connected by the logical AND operator are true, the overall result is
                            "true". Therefore, the result of the expression "(5 > 3 && 2 < 4)" is "true" . </p>
