            Q.47 What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <span>Ans - </span>
        <ul>
            <li>Code Duplication: Each object instance contains its own copy of methods, leading to redundant code and
                increased memory
                usage.</li>
            <li>Limited Dynamic Updates: Modifying methods dynamically at runtime is challenging when declared directly
                in objects,
                limiting adaptability to changing requirements.</li>
            <li>Testing Challenges: Tightly coupled methods make it difficult to isolate and test them independently,
                impacting the
                effectiveness of unit testing.</li>
            <li>Namespace Pollution: Increased risk of naming conflicts when different objects share method names,
                leading to unintended
                interactions and bugs.</li>
            <li>Difficulty in Maintenance: Updating or modifying methods requires changes to be applied to each object
                instance, making
                code maintenance more complex.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To address these issues, alternative patterns like constructor functions, prototypes, or ES6 classes are
            often
            recommended for better code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
