        <h2>Q.1 What is JavaScript. How to use it?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It enables the creation of
            dynamic,
            interactive content on websites by allowing developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and
            respond to user
            actions. As a client-side scripting language, it runs in web browsers, enhancing the user experience by
            enabling
            real-time updates without requiring page reloads.</p>
        <p>To use JavaScript, include it in your HTML documents using the
            "script" tag.You can embed scripts directly in HTML or link to external JavaScript files.JavaScript code is
            written in script blocks or in separate files with a ".js" extension.It covers a broad spectrum of
            applications, from simple form validations to complex single - page applications.With the growth of Node.js,
            JavaScript is now also used on the server - side, making it a full - stack language for building scalable
            and responsive web applications.</p>
