            Q.21 What is the use of Void (0)?
        </h3>

        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>In JavaScript, `void(0)` is often used in the context of using the `void` operator. The `void` operator
            evaluates an
            expression but then returns `undefined`. It's commonly used in situations where a script or a link's `href`
            attribute
            needs to be set to a JavaScript snippet that should not affect the current page or cause a navigation.</p>
        <h6>Here's an example:</h6>
        <h6>
            <!-- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="myFunction();">Click me</a> -->
        </h6>
        <p>In this example, clicking the link triggers the `myFunction` JavaScript function, but the `void(0)`
            expression is used
            in the `href` attribute to ensure that the link doesn't cause the page to navigate or change its state. It's
            a way to
            create a non-interactive link that still allows for JavaScript to be executed when the link is clicked.</p>
        <p>It's worth noting that in modern JavaScript and web development practices, the use of `void(0)` is somewhat
            outdated.
            Developers may use other techniques like event listeners or simply using `#` in the `href` attribute for
            similar
            purposes. Additionally, with the advent of more sophisticated frameworks and practices, inline JavaScript in
            attributes
            is often avoided in favor of unobtrusive event handling.</p>
