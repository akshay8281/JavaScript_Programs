        <p>Form validation is a crucial aspect of web development, ensuring that user-submitted data meets specific
            criteria before
            being processed. Let's discuss the theory behind validating email, number, and password fields in a form:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Email Validation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Objective: Verify that the entered email address adheres to a standard format.</li>
                    <li>
                        Theory: Use regular expressions to check for the presence of "@" and a valid domain in the email
                        input. Regular
                        expressions provide a powerful way to define a pattern for validating email formats.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Number Validation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Objective: Ensure that the entered value is a valid number.</li>
                    <li>Theory: Use JavaScript functions, such as isNaN, to check if the input is a numeric value.
                        Additionally, consider
                        constraints like minimum and maximum values, if applicable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Password Validation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Objective: Enhance security by enforcing certain criteria for password strength.</li>
                    <li>Theory: Specify password requirements, such as a minimum length and a combination of uppercase
                        letters, lowercase
                        letters, numbers, and special characters. This helps create stronger and more secure passwords.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Implementation:
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML Form Markup: Include form elements with appropriate attributes (e.g., type="email" and
                        type="number").</li>
                    <li>JavaScript Event Handling: Attach a JavaScript event listener to the form's submission event
                        (submit). This listener
                        triggers the validation process before data is sent to the server.</li>
                    <li>
                        Validation Logic: In the event handler, implement validation logic for each field using
                        JavaScript. If validation fails,
                        prevent the form from submitting and provide feedback to the user.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By combining these principles, developers create a user-friendly and secure form submission process. It
            ensures that
            users provide accurate and valid information, reducing the risk of errors and enhancing the overall quality
            of data
            collected through web forms.</p>
