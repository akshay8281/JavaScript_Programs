        // Example
        // Suppose n is initially 4567. The loop will execute as follows:
        // Iteration 1: n becomes 456.7
        // Iteration 2: n becomes 45.67
        // Iteration 3: n becomes 4.567
        // Iteration 4: n becomes 0.4567
        // Now, n is less than 10, and firstDigit is assigned the value of n, which is 4. So, the first digit of the original number 4567 is 4.

        let firstLastSummation = () => {
            let sum = 0;
            let firstDigit;
            let lastDigit;
            lastDigit = userNum % 10;
            //Find the first digit by dividing n by 10 until n greater then 10
            while (userNum >= 10) {
                userNum = Math.floor(userNum / 10);
            }
            // Result of First Digit from user Input
            firstDigit = userNum;
            //Calculate sum of first and last digit
            sum = firstDigit + lastDigit;
            return sum
