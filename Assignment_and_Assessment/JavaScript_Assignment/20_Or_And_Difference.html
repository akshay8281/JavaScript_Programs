            Q.20 What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <span>Ans - </span>
        <p>|| means “or”. It evaluates to true if the expression on either side is truthy.
            && means “and”. It evaluates to false if the expression on either side is falsy.</p>
        <p>If the expression on the left of && is falsy, it will immediately return false without checking the
            expression on the
            right. If the expression on the left of || is truthy, it will immediately return true without checking the
            expression on
            the right. (This is called “short circuiting”.)</p>
        <p>If I understand the question correctly, then what you are looking for is the ! (“not”) operator.</p>
        <p>a || b means “either a or b is truthy”.</p>
        <p>!(a || b) means “both a and b are falsy”. It could also be written as !a && !b.</p>
        <p>a && b means “both a and b are truthy”.</p>
        <p>!(a && b) means “either a or b is falsy”. It could also be written as !a || !b.</p>
